Pinche Fortaleza Cómics y desde 2018, gracias al apoyo de muchos lectores solidarios, No estamos aquí de visita.\nHemos hecho dos campañas exitosas, la que trajo a la vida la antología del maestro Ricardo Peláez ""Fuego Lento"" y la de este año, al publicar la espectacular edición de ""Operación Bolívar"" del maestro Edgar Clement.\nAhora estamos lanzando esta nueva campaña trayendo las 3 nuevas novelas gráficas de nuestros autores Tebin, Logan Wayne y H.G. Santarriaga.\nRota ¿Cómo superar el duelo y Ruptura? Esta \xa0es la alegoría de un grupo de corazones rotos y abandonados,\xa0cayendo en \xa0lo más profundo de su dolor.\xa0 Juntos vivirán una conmovedora historia metafórica de superación a través de símbolos y mensajes... Rota es la nueva novela gráfica de 64 páginas de Esteban Saldaña, TEBIN y es parte de este triple lanzamiento del que esperamos seas parte del mismo.\nLas Malas Lenguas es la cuarta novela gráfica de Logan Wayne, una vez más acompañado por la gráfica del artista Luis Erre. Todo mundo va a decir cosas de ella, las malas lenguas te dirán que se trata de una historia triste derivada del temblor del 2017, otros te dirán que es una historia del reencuentro de un hombre viejo y amargado con su hija fracasada, otros te dirán que es un catálogo de instrucciones de esos juegos a los que jugábamos cuando éramos niños y algunos más dirán que es una historia de redención, muerte y esperanza con una pizca de filosofía propia de la obra de Logan Wayne. Las Malas lenguas es una novela gráfica de 96 páginas que está urgida por que la devores con los ojos y con el corazón.\nSueños Rotos: Emi es la tercera parte de la trilogía Sueños Rotos, Primero fue la inquietante historia de Sofía. Después la desgarradora y contundente Julia y ahora llega Emi a cerrar este ciclo en el que se pone en un cómic el asunto tan delicado de la trata de personas.\xa0\nH.G. Santarriaga nos trae una novela gráfica de 96 páginas en las que conocemos la historia de EMI y después de esto estamos seguros que algo en tu interior jamás será igual.\nLa ausencia de eventos, debido a la pandemia nos motivó a hacer estas dinámicas de fondeo de proyectos, para obtener los recursos y así seguir publicando, \xa0sin embargo, ahora es también una buena herramienta para que tú, que estás leyendo esto y los demás lectores solidarios tengan nuestros nuevos lanzamientos a un precio extremadamente accesible, con unas recompensas bien nutridas y con la calidad y seriedad que te mereces y nos caracteriza.\nLos fondos \xa0serán útiles para hacer todo el proceso editorial hasta \xa0culminar en a la publicación de las 3 obras, mismas que ya están prácticamente terminadas.\nWe are Pura Pinche Fortaleza Cómics and since 2018, thanks to the support of many supportive readers, we are not visiting here. We have carried out two successful campaigns, the one that brought to life the anthology of maestro Ricardo Peláez ""Fuego Lento"" and this year\'s, by publishing the spectacular edition of ""Operación Bolívar"" by maestro Edgar Clement. We are now launching this new campaign bringing the 3 new graphic novels from our authors Tebin, Logan Wayne and H.G. Santarriaga. Broken How to overcome grief and Breakup? This is the allegory of a group of broken and abandoned hearts, falling into the depths of their pain. Together they will live a moving metaphorical story of overcoming through symbols and messages... Rota is the new 64-page graphic novel by Esteban Saldaña, TEBIN, and is part of this triple release that we hope you will be a part of. Las Malas Lenguas is Logan Wayne\'s fourth graphic novel, once again accompanied by graphic artist Luis Erre. Everyone is going to say things about her, gossips will tell you that it is a sad story derived from the 2017 earthquake, others will tell you that it is a story of the reunion of an old and bitter man with his failed daughter, others will tell you which is a catalog of instructions for those games we played when we were kids and some others will say that it is a story of redemption, death and hope with a pinch of philosophy typical of the work of Logan Wayne. Las Malas Lenguas is a 96-page graphic novel that is urgently needed for you to devour it with your eyes and with your heart. Broken Dreams: Emi is the third part of the Broken Dreams trilogy, First it was the disturbing story of Sofia. Then the heartbreaking and forceful Julia and now Emi arrives to close this cycle in which the delicate issue of human trafficking is put into a comic. H.G. Santarriaga brings us a 96-page graphic novel in which we learn about the history of EMI and after this we are sure that something inside you will never be the same. The absence of events, due to the pandemic, motivated us to do these project funding dynamics, to obtain the resources and thus continue publishing, however, now it is also a good tool for you, who are reading this and the other readers. solidarity have our new releases at an extremely affordable price, with well-nourished rewards and with the quality and seriousness that you deserve and that characterizes us. The funds will be used to carry out the entire editorial process until the publication of the 3 works, which are practically finished.\nA continuación Las Recompensas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperación Bolívar y Fuego Lento SC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperación Bolívar y Fuego Lento Firmados con sus copias digitales y Agradecimiento en los tres libros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos libros que puedes elegir .']"

I clearly remember the room I was in the moment I had an idea for a story. Then, I pulled all those references I liked (Dead Space, Resident Evil, Alien, Asimov, Tarantino, Murakami, Kitano, Vampire The Masquerade, etc.) to shape the world of Paralelo, and let the story unfold including the religion of Virtue, The Hive, Quantum Technology or Space Exploration.\xa0\nThe amazing illustrations from Nekro XIII, LAPAN and Agata Fiszer were commisioned as the final draft underway. They made me see I wanted more than just art for the book cover, but rather to release the novel as if it was a Comic: by several issues with cover illustrations providing the reader\'s imagination a peak on how the story would go on. This is also a way of hard scheduling deadlines to finish editing and releasing chapters, something those who are parents will understand. Additionally, I realised I was not going to be able to share the story with loads of people I had met in different countries through the years, and thus started the English translation process, double checked by the proof reading of a native speakers lot, led by my wife.\nThis campaign will allow me to:\n\n  Edit and release the story by issues in both languages and to publish it in e-format\n  Continue commissioning amazing illustrations to accompany each issue\n  Edit and publish printed versions in both languages\n\nAs an stretch goal, an additional English version review may be performed by a professional book editor. Other goals may come later!\n10 years, 250 pages and many and many reviews and proofreading later, I hope to publish it the way I\'d like it done: with high-quality illustrations bringing the words to life, and in two languages to make it accessible to the friends I made all over the world these last years.\nThank you so much for helping making it happen!\nDiego\n(ESP)\nComencé con el proyecto de Paralelo en 2012, mientras tabajaba en el Centro Europeo de Astronautas y en proyectos de Teleportación Cuántica. Recuerdo la sala donde estaba cuando tuve la idea de la historia. Luego pensé en todas esas referencias que me gustaban (Dead Space, Resident Evil, Alien, Asimov, Tarantino, Murakami, Kitano, Vampiro La Mascarada, etc.) para darle forma e ir construyendo el universo del libro con la religión de la Virtud, el Airball, \xa0La Colmena, la tecnología cuántica o la exploración espacial.\nPoco a poco, las ilustraciones de Nekro XIII, LAPAN y Agata Fiszer fueron dándole vida al concepto de publicación por fascículos, como si fuera un cómic, permitiéndole imaginar al lector lo que va a encontrarse en los párrafos siguientes. Ésto, también me permite ir cerrando la edición de capítulos a medida que avanza la publicación, algo que los que son padres entenderán. A su vez, me di cuenta de que si quiería compartir mi historia con gran parte de mis conocidos, debía traducirla al menos al inglés dado que no eran hispanoparlantes. Por tanto, comencé a traducir el texto an inglés, con la ayuda y revisión de nativos angloparlantes, liderados por mi mujer.\nApoyar a esta campaña permite:\n\n  Editar y publicar la historia en dos idiomas, por fascículos como libro electrónico\xa0\n  Continuar comisionando ilustraciones exclusivas para acompañar a cada volumen\n  Su edición y publicación impresa en ambos idiomas\n\nComo logro desbloqueable, de momento, sería posible una revisión adicional del texto por un editor inglés profesional. Otros están por venir...\nAños más tarde, espero poder hacer realidad mi sueño de publicarla con el formato en el que deseo hacerlo: incluyendo ilustraciones y en dos idiomas para hacerla accessible a mis amigos de todo el mundo. Muchísimas gracias por ayudarme a poder hacerlo realidad.\nParalelo printed book versions / ediciones impresas de Paralelo\n\nThanks to your pledge, the final editing and printing of the book may be not just possible but in two languages and in two formats: soft cover featuring LAPAN\'s cover art, and hard cover with Nekro XIII\'s illustration bringing the story of Paralelo to life.\nGracias a tu mecenazgo, Paralelo no solo podra ser editado y publicado, sino que lo hará en dos idiomas y en dos formatos: tapa blanda con ilustracion de portada de LAPAN, y tapa dura con la de Nekro XIII dándole vida a la historia.\n\n\n\n\nSoft Cover -by LAPAN- and Hard Cover -by Nekro XIII-book versions art / Arte de las portadas tapa blanda (por LAPAN) y tapa dura (por Nekro XIII)\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar Innovations Officially Licensed G\'old Goodies! / Merchandising oficial de Solar Innovations\n\nGet them with your pledge, or as an add on! /Cosíguelos con tu mecenazgo, o añádelos como extras\nT-shirts / Camisetas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool Paralelo T-shirts featuring Nekro XIII\'s art /Camiseta con la ilustración de Nekro XIII para la portada\nTote bags / Bolsas de tela\nTote cotton bag featuging S.I.\'s logo and the slogan displayed at the entrance of Social Hall 2B on Titan´s colony on one side; on the other, either Nekro XIII\'s or LAPAN´s cover art work.\nBolsas de Tela de S.I.

I was fascinated by the topic after learning of the Teleportation performed in Tenerife in 2012, for which you can find the link to ESA\'s on the picture below. This all, has heavily influenciated my already Sci-Fi / action \xa0/ rol populated mind, and helped me come up with a story I really enjoyed writing\xa0and seeing it unfold. I am now hoping and looking forward to sharing it with you.\xa0I hope you have a good time reading it.\n¡Hola!

Descubrí el tema de la teleportación cuántica tras el experimento que tuvo lugar en Tenerife en 2012 - enlace a la noticia de la ESA en la foto de abajo-. Mi mente ya estaba fuertemente influenciada por la ciencia ficción y el rol, pero me fascinó tanto que hizo surgir una historia que disfruté mucho escribiendo y viendo como se desplegaba sola. Ahora, me gustaría compartirla contigo y espero que te guste y entretenga.\n\n\n\n\nCredits @ESA\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd below here you can spot me at work at the time I came up with the idea vs my current self creating this campaign. Cheers!\nAquí me tienen manos en la consola cuando comencé con el proyecto vs mi yo actual creando esta campaña :-)\n\n\n\n\nHow it started - how it´s going / Como empezó y como vamos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards & Pledges / Recompensas y Mecenazgo\n\nThe available rewards are: book by e-issues, full e-book, illustrations in HR, illustrations card set, paperback printed version, hard cover printed version, goodies, \xa0and the possibility of publishing your art or short story (up to 3 pages and inspired by the book´s universe) on the Pledger\'s Annex.\nThe table below shows the rewards available with each version. Silco and Linium have the same rewards, paperback book in in English or Spanish. Same with Lagraña and Purity for the hard cover version. This seemed to be the best way to do it. Please note you can always personalize it with add-ons. Each version comes with an introduction to a main theme in the universe or Paralelo. I hope you enjoy reading trough them, and then... choose your weapon / version !\nLas recompensas disponibles son las siguientes: libro por fascículos electrónicos, ilustraciones en Alta Resolución, ilustraciones impresas, libro impreso en tapa blanda, libro impreso en tapa dura, goodies, \xa0y la posibilidad de publicar tu arte o tu relato corto (de hasta 3 páginas e inspirado en el universo del libro) en el Anexo Mecenas.\nLa tabla siguiente lista las diferentes versiones y las recompensas atribuidas a cada una de ellas. Silco y Linium tienen las mismas recompensas, sólo que el libro en tapa blanda es en español o en inglés. Lo mismo pasa con las versiones Lagraña y Purity. Esta parecía ser la mejor forma de separar las versiones en ambos idiomas. Ten en cuenta que siempre puedes personalizar las recompensas con los complementos. Cada version incluye un pequeño comentario sobre algún pilar del mundo de Paralelo. Espero que disfrutes leyéndolos y adentrándote en la historia. ¡Elige tu arma / version!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitan\n(ENG)\nDiscover the inside outs of Solar Innovation´s multiplanetary society and find out what is happening in Titan: there is much more than meets the eye on S.I.\'s crown colony jewel.\nContents:\n\n  Endless gratitude for helping making it happen\n  \xa0Book issues in both languages\n\nPledge: 6€\n(ESP)\nDescubre los entresijos de la sociedad multiplanetria creada por Solar Innovations, y lo que está ocurriendo en Titán: no todo es lo que parece en la colonia joya de la corona multiplanetaria de S.I.\nContenidos:\n\n  Gracias infinitas por haber contribuido a la edición final\n  Fascículos en ambos idiomas\n\nContribución: 6€\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtuoso\n(ENG)\nThe religion of Virtue has reduced criminality in the Solar System to derisory levels.

It\'s live now! Check it out at APAH.ca!\n\nWhat is the Alberta Political Accountability Hub?\nThe APAH is an online service built to help Albertans hold their government accountable by bringing everything you need to know about Alberta\'s politics together in a single, easy-to-navigate website. Our primary focus is accessibility - it doesn\'t matter if you\'re busy, and it doesn\'t matter if you\'re super familiar with politics. Anyone can access the site and use it to benefit themselves.\nCrucially, we are not an opinion service, nor are we a news organization. Think of us more along the lines of something like Wikipedia - come to us whenever you want to be able to quickly learn what exactly is happening with our government.\xa0\n\nWhen is it going live?\nThe site will be going live ten days before the election, at midnight on April 7th!\n\nWhat\'s on the site?\nThe APAH has five clearly defined, user-friendly categories for information:\n\nRepresentatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, you\'ll find everything you need to know about your MLA - a biography in both written and video form, some quick details about them, and information about what they\'ve done in the Legislature. You can find their voting records, contact info, sponsored legislation, and affiliations through here.\n\nLegislation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you tired of hearing an endless back and forth discussion on legislation that\'s just a ""This government is ruining the economy!"" ""No, this government is saving the economy!"" where you don\'t actually learn what the proposed legislation does? The APAH\'s Legislation section is designed to make it possible for the first time for Albertans to have access to the facts of the legislation, without commentary, presented in an easy-to-read format.\n\nCommittees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committees section is going to tell you about when the committees are meeting, who the committee members are, what each specific committee does, and what committees in general do.\n\nParties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, you\'ll find everything you need to know about the parties of yesteryear and today. If you want to learn about the histories of these parties, we have crash course videos and written histories for you. If you want to learn how they stand on policies and stack up against one another, we have that information lined up too. If you want to know more about the leaders, we have that information for you - again, both in written and video form.\n\nElections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch by riding or by party to find out who you want to support in the 2019 election, including access to their websites and social media. Voting is a complicated, frequently frustrating process of trying to determine who believes in what and who these people are, but with the APAH, all that information is just a couple clicks away.\n\nWhy did you make it?\nBefore the APAH, being politically informed meant one of two things - trying to search through a hedge maze of sites to find the single line or two of information that you needed, or else trying to sift through news stories and pick out the fact from the fiction. The Alberta Political Accountability Hub has all the information you need to know to be capable of making informed political decisions - and with an election right around the corner, that\'s never been more important.\xa0\n\nAnd who exactly are you?\nMy name is Wyatt Tanton, and I\'m a 20 year-old who was originally from Camrose (about an hour south-east of Edmonton), but I\'ve moved around a lot over the years - Mill Bay on Vancouver Island, Warwick in Australia, and Montreal, in Quebec. I chose to start the first Political Accountability Hub in Alberta because I know that this is a province where people, regardless of their political leanings, just want to be able to make the decisions that are right for their family - and unfortunately, we\'ve had decades of governments in this province who make it as hard as possible for us to figure out what\'s best for us. \xa0\n\nWhere can we find you?\nWell, obviously, there\'s APAH.ca - this is the main site for our service. However, we will also have Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts designed to help keep people updated in whichever way is most convenient. We will also have a YouTube channel, which will be a supplementary service - from here, we\'re going to have informational videos on a wide range of topics, from policy deep-dives on complicated subjects, to Politics 101-style videos explaining the basics of politics, to videos on Alberta\'s history. All of these videos will also hopefully be released on services like Spotify as podcasts so that they can be used however is convenient.\xa0\n\nHow will you fund it?\nThree forms - Kickstarter, merchandise, and Patreon. This Kickstarter\'s goal of $50,000 is the minimum necessary to run this service and keep providing accurate, unbiased information for a year. However, Kickstarter also allows us to go over our goal, and the further the APAH is funded past that goal, the more we can expand. Hitting the goal just means that we will for sure be funded, but everything past that allows us to provide an even better service. We will also be selling merchandise to raise money, and running a Patreon alongside the service to allow people to support the APAH on a monthly basis to give us a more stable income. With all three of these revenue streams, the APAH will be able to build and grow into exactly what Albertans need - a no-frills, easily accessible source of political information.\n\nWhy are you asking us for funding? Why not the government?\nThis one\'s easy - frankly, a program that\'s supposed to hold the government in check doesn\'t usually have great success when it\'s paid for by the government. The only way for this service to be truly capable of this is if we\'re by Albertans, for Albertans.\xa0\nAlso, crucially, the APAH will be going live before the 2019 election.

It’s a magical art form, a genre of storytelling in its own right, one that excites children and adults alike. Animation involves immersing yourself in a different world, a world where the only limit is your imagination.\nWe are flipbook makers, but also animators, and we love imagining new things. This flipbook collection is the definitive introduction to the most important principles of animation, the rules that every animator should know. Why? Let’s find out! ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose of you familiar with our flipbooks know that they exhibit a clever trick: instead of one or two animations as in a normal flipbook, our publications feature up to six different animations (How does it work? You’ll have to figure it out by yourself ;)). And because there are 12 basic principles of animation, it’s the perfect number to create a double flip book set comprising two volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach volume features six original animations by Raúl García, one for each principle. On the first page of each sequence you’ll find an explanatory text about the principle concerned, to enable you to get a better understanding of what you see when you flip the book.\nBoth flipbooks come protected in their individual slipcases to prevent the pages from wearing out. These are additionally housed in a sleek double sleeve that holds them together so you can keep them in your favorite place. The collection also includes two foldable paper cubes with content relating to each principle in augmented reality format. See more about this below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose of you familiar with our flipbooks know that we like a little magic! Most of our publications feature a clever trick that owes its success to a sophisticated assembly technique, and this is why we call them cinemagic flipbooks. As a result, when flipping the pages of the book, you can see up to six different animations instead of one or two as in a normal flipbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur cinemagic flipbooks are surprisingly easy to use and provide an unfailing source of delight to viewers of all ages. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 12 principles are a set of core concepts based on decades of animation work carried out by Disney\'s ""Nine Old Men”, the legendary animators largely responsible for the success of some of the most remarkable and celebrated films in the history of animated cinema, as Disney was transitioning from doing shorts to feature films in the 1930s. It was a gradual process of discovery and refinement as the animators tried to push their work to unprecedented heights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 12 principles were first compiled by the iconic animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in their 1981 book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation. The 12 principles have since become known and respected as the 12 fundamental rules of animation, particularly within the American tradition (ie Disney, Warner Bros, Pixar, etc.), but they also apply to a range of animation techniques such as 3D and stop motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are absolutely thrilled to be able to develop this project in partnership with the great Raúl García, who for many years has worked for major studios such as Disney, Paramount and Hanna-Barbera on classic feature films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Pocahontas and Fantasia 2000, among many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also collaborated on several major productions such as Asterix Versus Caesar, The Chipmunk Adventure and The Land Before Time, and later became a sequence director for Paramount on films such as Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, The Wild Thornberrys Movie and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, nominated for an Oscar for best animated feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002 he joined Kandor Graphics as creative director, producing the award-winning short film The Tell-Tale Heart, and as a co-writer and director with Manuel Sicilia on the feature film The Missing Lynx, winner of the Goya award for best animated feature in 2008. He was director and producer of the animated feature film Extraordinary Tales, based on the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, which won him a nomination as best director of an independent feature film at the 2016 ANNIE Awards, as well as several other international awards.\n\n            \n\n          \n\nIn the conversations we held leading up to this project, Raúl often left us open-mouthed with the numerous insider anecdotes and stories he has accumulated over the course of his many years in the animation business. He is also remarkable for the pedagogical skills and knowledge that he shares as part of the many courses and workshops he leads around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the illusion of life is what the principles are all about. They help animators create characters that appear to have weight, personality and existence in a real world where the real laws of physics apply. Many animators will tell you that good animation has less to do with the design and mannerisms of your characters, and more to do with how reactive their personalities and appearance are to what\'s going on around them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first principle is Squash and stretch. It refers to how an object changes shape in response to forces acting upon it. A bouncing ball, for example, won\'t always have the same shape, which will vary according to its position and consistency. Anticipation is a smaller movement that comes before a major one, and signals that the major movement is about to happen, e.g. a character bending its knees before it jumps. Staging is all about guiding the viewer\'s eye toward what\'s important within the scene, while Straight-ahead and pose-to-pose are different approaches to animating, either creating each new frame in sequence from beginning to end, or creating the key poses for each action first, then filling in the in-betweens. Follow-through and overlapping action refers to the tendency of different parts of a body to move at different speeds, while Slow-in and slow-out specifies the tendency of objects to gradually accelerate when moving from one position to another. Think about how a car will start moving slowly, before gaining momentum and speeding up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second volume you’ll learn about Arcs, a principle stemming from the observation that living things don\'t move in straight lines, but rather in curved trajectories. Secondary action refers to smaller movements that support the primary actions of a character. These actions make the shot clearer by emphasizing the attitude or motivation behind the movement. Then there is Timing, one of the most fundamental principles, which helps you control the speed of an action through the number of frames used to represent it. Too much realism can ruin an animation, making it appear static and boring. Instead, add some Exaggeration to your characters and objects to make them more dynamic. Solid drawing means posing characters in a way that creates a sense of volume, weight and balance; it also means being able to draw the characters from any angle or pose, with three-dimensionality in mind. And finally Appeal. This is a broad term for any qualities of a character\'s design that make it inherently compelling to watch. This includes the design of the character, as well as how the character is animated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like our previous Molecularis and Dots & Lines publications, The 12 Principles of Animation is a coloring flipbook as well. As can be seen in the visuals, all the sequences are line-drawn characters that are perfect for coloring, and can be redrawn and varied with an endless number of possibilities. In this way, the flipbook becomes an entertaining and fun activity not only for children, but for anyone who wants to spend some quality time alone or with their family, and get away from the screens and media for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have chosen a high quality paper suitable for all kinds of coloring techniques; use pencils, markers, watercolors, graphite, brushes, technical pens or whatever technique you prefer.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen thinking about how to integrate the 12 principles into augmented reality, we suddenly had a brainwave: of course, cubes were needed! One cube has six sides and two cubes have 12, making them the perfect complement for the flipbook.\nThis feature will be available thanks to an easy-to-use iOS and Android app developed by our friends from Artivive, a revolutionary AR company based in Vienna, Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one cube for each volume, and they’ll be easily recognizable because of their matching colors. The cubes come in cardboard to be assembled by yourself - making them is child’s play. Once they have been assembled, simply scan the QR code included in the flip book to install the Artivive App. Open the app and see how the drawings on each side of the cube come to life while turning into real-time animations on your screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the sequences will be shown in a loop, so you can see them in a more fluid and prolonged way. Together with the flipbook, the AR cubes will make a valuable learning tool to improve your animation skills - or you can even play dice and turn your learning process into a game :).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re familiar with our previous flipbook publications, you probably know that education plays an important role in our philosophy as a brand. We really like to push the boundaries of our editions, to look for new interactive elements that can extend the length of time users engage with the flip books and offer a unique and lasting experience.\nIn this new publication, education again plays a crucial role, because the flipbook is deliberately designed to help users learn about animation.The great advantage of the 12 principles being represented in a flipbook is that you can go frame by frame (or page by page, which in this case is the same), studying each principle with its respective text on the first page of each sequence. This gives you a better understanding of not only the meaning of each principle, but also how to actually apply it effectively to your animations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents can discover the principles in an engaging, interactive way using a medium that represents a precursor of cinema itself; at the same time, thanks to augmented reality, the collection bridges the gap between old-school and cutting-edge technology. A truly unique educational tool for all ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this campaign we have come up with several appetizing bundles, which may eventually find their way onto your bookshelves. :) For those who want to get started right away with their own animations, consider picking our Animator’s Bundle with our Blanko Flipbook.\nThe Student’s Pack includes the flipbook and a fabulous 6-part online course by Raúl García on Drawing for Animation. In this course, Raúl explains the most important aspects of character design: surface lines, diminishing size, contact shadows, overlapping shapes, lines of action, silhouette, caricature, simple shapes, color and anatomy, and also gives some good examples of how to find inspiration to come up with interesting and convincing characters.\nRaúl García’s Pack includes several books that have been published related to Raúl’s feature animation film Extraordinary Tales inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, such as our 6x1 flipbook we made some time ago featuring six original sequences from the film. After the campaign you’ll be able to choose between the art book Jack Mircala and the ART of Extraordinary Tales or the beautiful graphic novel La Caída de la Casa Usher published by La Cúpula Ediciones. Please note! The graphic novel is available only in Spanish. If you want to have both books, you can add the other one as an add-on after the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here\'s the kicker: we have 10 Exclusive Original Cel Drawings from Raúl\'s time at Hanna-Barbera that actually made it into the series: six from The Flintstones and four from Lucky Luke. These cel drawings are hand-painted on a piece of celluloid acetate, and have been photographed over a background painting to create a frame for the finished movie. Each cel comes together with its respective background and framed, all ready to be put on display wherever you choose. Original production cels are one-of-a-kind pieces of art and a wonderful way to own and display a “moment in time” from a film, a show, or a character that you love.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping will be charged AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the survey stage.\nBelow is an estimate of shipping costs broken down by shipping area. These are only estimates; however we commit to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay. The dollar symbol refers to US dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-Ons:\nAll individual flipbooks and bundles can be added to your pledge AFTER THE CAMPAIGN and at the same cost. We intentionally chose not to offer Kickstarter add-ons within the campaign to keep the survey process as easy as possible for everyone. Shipping costs for add-ons will be charged by weight; this way we can calculate them as precisely as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlipboku is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and film music composer Julie Reier. We have both been working in the world of film for many years and love all things related to animation, books and design. We loved the idea of having our own flipbook publishing house, so we started the project in 2016 and it has grown steadily since then.\nToday, the Flipboku team is made up of six members, all working in our design and printing studio Boku Lab in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The rest of the team consists of the invaluable hands of our illustrator and graphic designer Noemi Aiolo and our irreplaceable production technicians Gustavo Berdayes, Tomás Pons and José Ramón Pineda, responsible for the entire production process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2019 we have had our own printing workshop where 100% of the production is carried out. This means that the entire production process is under our control, allowing for precise results and finishes, in harmony with our commitment and obsession with design and quality. It took us several years to refine our cinemagic flip books and their optical illusion features, but thanks to the talented hands of our experienced print masters, we were able to fine-tune the concept to perfection.\nHere you can get a glimpse of the super effective teamwork of the Boku crew:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though we’re already experienced flipbook makers, there’s a lot of work that goes into developing a collection like The 12 Principles. For this flipbook we had the invaluable help of Raúl García, who’s already devoted many hours of work in creating the 12 animated sequences of the flipbook. These 12 sequences had to be adapted to the flipbook format; we had to make several prototypes until we got the right order, layout, paper and design. Finally we needed to think about how to include the two paper cubes that come with the collection.\nNow we need your help to complete the final step – to bring The 12 Principles to life and secure a minimum print run of 1,000 units.

She is usually depicted as a mercenary, hunter of war criminals, leader of the Wild Pack, and owner of Silver Sable International. While not a criminal, her work as a mercenary has sometimes brought her into conflict with several superheroes. Silver Sable is primarily an ally and sometimes enemy of Spider-Man.\nThe character has appeared in several media adaptations over the years, including animated series and video games.\nIn this film, Silver Sable has to rescue her younger sister Laybird from a group of ex-military solders known as the Blue Shrikes.\n\nSo a little backstory about Ladybird and the Blue Shrikes:\nLadybird is the younger sister of Silver Sable who is the sole protector of Symkaria (A former soldier in the Symkarian Army) and also the CEO of Sable International. Ladybird is looks up to Silver Sable and wants to follow in her footsteps. Ladybird is less serious and less organized than Silver Sable where she does things on the fly, very outspoken. She’s in her mid 20s so she’s on the verge of creating her own identity.\nBlue Shrikes are an ex-militant group from Estonia 🇪🇪 who are against the partnership of Estonia and Symkaria (Symkaria is a fictitious country in the Marvel Universe which is based on the country of Latvia 🇱🇻)\nThe Blue Shrike soldiers are working for the tyrant Andris who was second in command of the Blue Shrikes to the father of Silver Sable and Ladybird but the father fell in love with a Symkarian woman so he left Estonia 🇪🇪 and his position as the leader of the Blue Shrikes thus creating a personal war between Silver Sable and the Blue Shrikes. The Blue Shrikes consist of soldiers that the country of Estonia 🇪🇪 forgot after the Symkaria-Estonia wars and they never mentally healed after those wars before the two respected countries decided to sign a treaty that ensured one would help each other out if they ever encountered financial struggles.']"

This escapade is to brought to life with animated characters drawn by academy award nominated cartoonist Bill Plympton with voice over by his lifelong friend Bennie Goodson.\nMatthew Markus, aka Matt Limo, was born in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1975. In his youth he was known as an iconoclast who shunned traditional societal norms.

While traveling, he would constantly write about his adventures in a notebook that he eventually published between 1992 to 1997 in three ""Limo Zines"" as his homemade magazine.

If you \xa0visit our past campaigns, you can track our monitoring of the situation as it has unfolded over the past two years.\n\nTo mitigate the risk, we are charging for shipping separately closer to the campaign fulfillment. Fulfillment will be handled by our warehousing partners in the United States and Europe. We've learn a lot over the past year on how to work with warehouses, and we're working to implement improvements on the process across the board, which we've detailed in the Skies of Fire #8 Post-Mortem here. \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creative minds behind Skies of Fire and Mythopoeia, Vincenzo Ferriero \xa0and Ray Chou have been collaborating on creative projects since 2008 despite living 5,437 miles apart. \xa0Find us on Instagram and Tik Tok: @mythopoeians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art. @pablopop_\n\nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in \xa0Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various \xa0projects from top publishers in the industry. @bryan_valenza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and \xa0illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all \xa0kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at \xa0attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions \xa0branch of the Romanian Army. @wingsofwrath\n\nCristian Docolomansky Cerda (C.D.C.) is a \xa0Barcelona-born inker and letterer based in Chile. He's worked with \xa0several publishers such as Alterna Comics, IDW, and Ariete Producciones. \xa0You can find him here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis campaign represents the culmination of eight years of sweat, pain, and tears. When we launched Skies of Fire in 2014, all we had was a dream, a script, and a few pages of artwork.\xa0\n\nThough we were confident we'd be able to tell our story, we never could imagine the journey Skies of Fire has taken us. \xa0From Bucharest to San Diego, we've exhibited at comic conventions all over the world, \xa0learning about the business of creativity along the way, which at times has been both rewarding and excruciating.\xa0\n\nStill, this project - and every one that has come since - represents the manifestation of our dreams and aspirations as young filmmakers, all those years ago.\xa0\n\n\xa0If you're a supporter of Skies of Fire, past or present, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\xa0\n\nWe couldn't have done it without you.\xa0\n\n- Ray and Vince""]"

needed to be creative to find work in the field of carpentry. I wanted to purchase a CNC machine to start a cabinet shop. After being turned town by numerous banks for a small business start up loan, my wife and I decided to finance it ourselves. We drained our savings and tapped out our credit cards. The end result was a machine that not only worked, but launched our business to new levels. Only a year and a half after completion I am now working full time making monograms and wood letters. I now have two employees and we sell to 55 stores around the US! Building my own CNC machine has been life changing for me! Now comes the problem, we want to add another axis to one of our machines. Our business is booming, in our first year from August to December we had over $60,000 in sales. Pretty impressive for just starting. In our second year we are on track to double that. Any bank would lend us money to expand- WRONG! Even though our credit is excellent, we are being denied business loans because we tapped out our credit cards. Are we getting them paid down, sure, but slowly with as high as the interests rates are. This project will allow us to expand our business further, by creating another dimension so we can keep up with the demand of our stores. We are grateful that websites like this exist, so that small business can flourish even with lack of generosity from the banking industry.']"

There are all sorts of things you can do with a device like this. You can create wearables like a watch, bracelet, pendant, or buckle that displays color images, attach sensors and display data in text or visual form, display debug information, create a graphics user interface, or even make simple retro games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures / specifications\nProcessor : Atmel Atmega328P @ 5V / 16MHz\nIO pins : 14 digital, 6 analog \nMemory : 32K flash, 2K RAM\nVoltage regulator : TPS61202 5V boost converter\nInput voltage : 1.5 - 5.5V recommended\nSupply current : 100mA @ 0.5V, 1A @ 3V, 1.3A @ 3.7V\nPower connector : JST PH (standard for small LiPo cells)\xa0 \nDisplay : 128x128 16-bit color 1.5"" (38mm) OLED w/ SSD1351 driver\nPCB Size : 1.7"" x 1.7"" (43 x 43mm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display on the Pixelduino is compatible with Adafruit\'s GFX library. This \nlibrary provides functions for blitting images, drawing primitives like \nlines and circles, and even includes basic bitmapped font support. The theoretical maximum speed of this display when streaming from the SD card and refreshing the entire screen is ~10 \nfps. This is based on the speed of the SPI bus and the amount of \ndata that needs to be pushed around.The display controller also has \nsome graphics acceleration built in, allowing you to redraw only specific parts of the screen (enabling sprite rendering by tracking dirty rectangles) or change the display offset to scroll vertically. (Of course, if you want to do horizontal scrolling in hardware, you can always rotate the screen by 90 degrees!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pixelduino is also compatible with the Arduino\'s SPI and SD libraries. Communication with the display and MicroSD card are both handled with \nthe SPI bus on pins 10-13.\xa0 Pins 8 and 9 are also used to command the \ndisplay.\xa0 Aside from these, the rest of the pins are available for any \nuse.\xa0 The I2C bus for example is available on pins A4 and A5. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the image above you can see the board includes a convenient 2mm JST PH connector, just like those found on small LiPo batteries and some alkaline battery packs.The board can run on 1 to 3 alkaline, lithium, or NiMh batteries, as well as single-cell LiPo batteries. The on-board boost regulator efficiently steps the voltage up to the 5V the board requires, and has a built in linear regulator to step the voltage down when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew firmware can be loaded using the Arduino IDE with the same USB serial FTDI programmers boards like the Arduino Pro use, or with an ISP programmer using a pogo-pin adapter.The circuit seen in the video is a proof of concept using the same screen and processor that will be used on the final board. The final design is complete and ready to go into production as soon as we reach our funding goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pixelduino is open hardware and the schematics and PCB layout \nwill be made available so you can manufacture them yourself or learn\n from the design and improve upon it!\n\nProduction timelineHere is the timeline for completing each phase of the project:\nDesign schematic - DONE\n\nLayout PCB - DONE\n\nCreate Bill of Materials - DONE\n\nAssemble and test prototype - DONE\n\nAcquire funding on Kickstarter - IN PROGRESS\n\nThank everyone for their support!\nOrder parts + get first round of PCBs made for testing\nAssemble and test boards\nIf necessary, correct any mistakes and order another round of PCBs for testing\nOrder final assembled boards\nBurn bootloader onto all boards\nShip!\nWhy Kickstarter?We set out to design this board after seeing a similar product with a \ntiny monochrome screen that we thought we could improve upon. But hardware is expensive, and color OLED screens even more so. To produce these boards at this price point, we need to order several hundred of them at a time. And we don\'t even know if there\'s a market for it. But we hope there is!Please back our Kickstarter.\xa0 Thank you! - Rabid PrototypesPS:The chiptunes in our pitch video were graciously provided under a Creative Commons license by \'RoccoW\'.\xa0 If you enjoyed them you can find more of his stuff on Youtube and Soundcloud.']"

According to our research, the majority of smartphone users backup and clean up their device every 1-2 months or they do it when they are forced to.\n\nBacking up and cleaning up our smartphones shouldn\'t be hard ! We have too many things in life that needs cleaning, our desks, living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. Our smartphones shouldn\'t take time to clean up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDropbox, Google Drive, Box... All of them are free and easy to use, but I have a ""pictures"" folder in every cloud ! How do I keep track of these pictures? If I have to delete it which public clouds do I need to go to? Can they backup each other? Do I actually have a backup saved in my home?\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the demand for PC continues to drop, more and more people now use smartphone and tablets instead of computers. However, as technology nowadays evolve in a tremendous speed, most functions of smartphone and tablets may become too complicated for some of the users who never use computers in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who are fluent with computers, the process of backing up files are complicated. We are stuck with the small memory size mobile device we had. Cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox provide automatic backup services for free, but those free cloud space are never enough. Additional cloud storage space meant additional costs for the user.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Although Google+ has a powerful fix photo function but it is extremely difficult to post those fixed photos onto Facebook. This is because large public cloud companies will not collaborate with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to have :\nA network router which can be connected to Syncube through cable or WiFi.\nA portable USB hard drive which is not provided in the pledge program.

I\'m Jessica Marie Francis and this is my first book.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow We Got HereI chose Kickstarter for this project because it gives me the chance to be thoughtful about how this book reaches its audience.\xa0My path to publishing a children’s book is anything but conventional.\xa0 By trade, I’m a children and family photographer.\xa0 I have a BA in Philosophy and an MAMC in web design and online communication, both from the University of Florida (inserting the requisite #GoGators here). \xa0I started my career at UF as an architecture student, and my favorite job title I’ve ever earned is “bread shaper” at a local French-inspired bakery.\xa0With that background in mind, this part sounds a little less off the wall: I want to create and publish Fine Art books for toddlers that foster creativity, connection, and communication.\xa0 So much of my experience, so much of myself is wrapped up in this project.What makes this book special?\xa0 It’s designed to start conversations.\xa0 We love open-ended play and imaginative exploration; this book brings that to you.\xa0 “What is that thing?”, “I’ve never looked at a prepackaged snack quite that way before…” \xa0All the images in the book are Fine Art quality images taken in the thick of raising a toddler with a Pixel 8 Pro – the tool I almost always have on hand as a busy mom.\xa0 I want to show people the beauty of the smallest moments.\xa0 The light. The shadow. The shape of childhood.I so appreciate this platform and the chance to share my work with a larger audience.\xa0 Thank you for stopping by!\xa0 Please share as you see fit.<3 JMF\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BookThis will be a 6"" x 6"" board book with a soft-touch matte cover. \xa0Perfect for little fingers. \xa0Designed to create a tactile experience, this visually stimulating book focuses nearly as much on how it feels to interact with the cover and pages as the importance of the images and words contained on them. \xa0Because of the board book format, the smallest first run available to us was 500 copies... hence the Kickstarter campaign.']"

where I could publish MY story; a place where it would be supported and not be asked to fit into whatever box is the biggest trend at the moment. I remember worrying I wouldn’t be able to find a place I wanted to call “home” for my story—that no place would quite fit all the details I’d imagined. But Story-weaver wanted to work\xa0with\xa0me and my story instead of just trying to make a buck, and while I did have to spend quite a while ruminating on my decision, I’m glad I decided to come to a publisher that had my best interest at heart.\n\nFROM THE PUBLISHER\n\n\n\n\nOur mission at Story-weaver Publishing is to provide a home for authors who write gritty but God-honoring fiction. It is a privilege to bring stories like Lindsay’s into the world, and we’re so excited to sign her on as a Storyweaver author!The world of Valara is one filled with mystery, curses, deities, legends, and more. From dreaded pirates to Carnivale, princesses and monsters, there is something for readers to dive into and enjoy. We cannot wait for you to join Lindsay in publishing her debut novel!\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\n\n\n\nAs long as Aaren poses as a man, none of her crewmates aboard the Crimson Lord can guess at her mysterious past. But when her disguise is exposed, she must return to land to prove herself and regain her crew’s trust. Her mission is simple: steal a ring off the king’s neck.But a brutal murderer lurks on the coast, one who seems bent on exposing her whereabouts. Pressured by her exile, chased by a serial killer, Aaren races to earn her spot back at sea before she loses her head—or herself.\n\nMEET THE AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Raymon-James decided in third grade that she was supposed to be an author; it just took a few years for her stories to catch up. A long time lover of fantasy, it’s no surprise she ended up crafting her own worlds to gallivant off to when she was supposed to be working on “taxes”. Now, she can’t imagine life without stories as she continues to challenge herself to step into new and fantastical projects, pushing herself to always be growing in her craft. \xa0She does find referring to herself in the third-person a bit strange, though.\n\nREWARD OPTIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goal #1: HARDCOVER EDITIONThere's something beautiful about a hardcover book, which is why if we hit $4,500 during the campaign, we'll be able to publish a hardcover edition of The Wayward Sword.\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goal #2: CHARACTER ARTNothing brings a story to life like artwork from your world. Getting to see the things that have lived rent-free in your mind for years (sometimes decades) is an amazing feeling!If we can raise $5,000, that will allow us to find the right artist to match the style and feel of Lindsay's world and bring her characters to life in a whole new way.\n\nBONUS MATERIALS\n\n\n\n\nAs a bonus to all our backers, we offer additional “perks” for supporting our authors as a way of thanking you.\n\nAll ebooks are DRM-free, which means you can load them on any device: Kindle, Nook, Kobo e-reader, computer, smartphone, or tablet without any locking mechanisms that prevent you from moving files from place to place.\n\nYour name will be printed in the acknowledgment section so everyone will see that you are an awesome supporter of the project (you can opt-out if you choose or specify the name of a loved one instead).\n\nAll rewards include an invitation to the virtual launch party (date TBD closer to publication) where you’ll get to hang out with the author and ask questions about the book.\n\nJoin the Author Community and receive special updates from the author specifically over the publishing process.\n\n\nABOUT THE PROJECT\n\n\n\n\nWe’re up-front about what the costs are with our authors, and we also want to be transparent with the backers too. Everything the campaign covers is listed out below in full. When you back a project, you’re helping the author get the professional editing, cover design, and layout a book deserves.\n\nCover Design: covers ebook/paperback design.\n\nEditing: This book will go through professional editing and proofreading.\n\nLayout Design: Formatting the book will bring the polish that readers expect.\n\nKickstarter fees: 10% comes off the top of each campaign.\n\nPublishing Fees: Our publishing fee covers things like website maintenance and subscriptions used to run the publisher.\n\nPrinting: Cost of printing the books.\n\n\nABOUT SHIPPING\n\n\n\n\nShipping is not included in the prices. This is because single books are far less expensive to ship than others that will require a bigger box or envelope. Prices are based on USPS Ground Advantage shipping rates and ensure your rewards arrive in a timely manner once published.We are currently limiting shipping to within the United States due to international shipping costs.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n\n\n\nProduction of a quality book is no mean feat. There are several rounds of editing, revisions on the cover designs, formatting, layout, and proofreading. Most take a month or more to complete as we work with our authors to bring their vision to life. Here’s a general guideline you can expect:\n\nMonths 1-3: Developmental edits, cover design concepts, revisions\n\nMonths 4-6: Finalizing cover design, Line edits or copyedits depending on which is needed\n\nMonths 7-9: Finalizing edits, proofread, layout and formatting\n\nMonths 10-12: Prepping files, printing and shipping books, full publishing launch\n\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\n\n\n\n\nStory-weaver Publishing uses Kickstarter as a way to eliminate or minimize author fees while making sure our editors, designers, and formatters get paid based on their rates. It also allows us to work with our authors on extras like character art or map design, which can be included in the campaign if they choose to have it.\xa0The other awesome aspect of Kickstarter is that you get to support an author before their book is published! You are the foundation of their reader base. You get to help them achieve their dreams of writing and publishing books while getting rewards regular buyers won’t get after this.\n\nNEW TO KICKSTARTER?\n\n\n\n\nIf you're new to pledging on Kickstarter, here's a short overview of how it works.Kickstarter is a platform that allows artists and creatives to crowdfund projects directly. If the campaign goal is reached within the allotted time, then your card will be charged and we will begin working to fulfill those orders by the dates stated on the reward. If the goal is not reached, your card will NOT be charged.\xa0After the campaign is complete, we'll reach out for additional info like shipping addresses, so please make sure you are watching for things like that after the campaign.\n\nCREATIVE TEAM\n\n\n\n\nWhen he published his first book in 2020, he saw the need for a publisher focused on Christian Fiction dealing with harder topics. After much prayer, he started Story-weaver Publishing, not only for his books, but to build a home for like-minded authors seeking to honor God through the art of storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom playing make-believe with her backyard neighbors to now working on her own science fantasy trilogy, Emily Vest has always loved everything storytelling. She is thrilled to join the team at Story-weaver Publishing, and she aims to hone her passion for writing and editing by helping fellow writers polish their own stories and reach publishing success!While in school, Emily worked as The Cedarville Review editor-in-chief, a workshop leader, and a writing center tutor before getting her start as a freelance editor with Honeycomb Author Services. Currently, she is working on her debut novel and her trilogy but also has published poetry and short-form prose in The Albion Review, Adelaide Literary Magazine, and The Cedarville Review. She has a Bachelor's degree in English Literature with three minors in Creative Writing, Editing & Publishing, and Biblical Studies from Cedarville University.Brianna currently works as an associate editor and project coordinator for Innovo Publishing LLC. She is also a freelance editor for the Christian Publishing Portal. Now, she's excited to join the team at Story-weaver Publishing! She has a Bachelor's in Professional Writing and Information Design, a minor in Editing and Publishing, and a minor in Biblical Studies from Cedarville University.Cheyenne van Langevelde has loved storytelling since she was little, making up tragic adventures with Playmobil and turning every playground into a sinking ship. Being a voracious reader as long as she can remember, she began writing her own stories back in 2014. Since then, she has successfully self-published two novels and has experience in both the traditional and indie publishing spheres.\xa0Benita Thompson has been writing since she was a five-year-old inspired by the Bobbsey Twins and Little House on the Prairie. During high school she self-published three books, discovering a love for book design in the process. She has been offering cover design and formatting services since 2016, with a commitment to providing professional-tier design on an indie author budget. Her specialty focus is in fantasy and speculative fiction\n\nABOUT THE PUBLISHER\n\n\n\n\nAt Story-weaver Publishing LLC, our aim is to honor God and the beautiful art of storytelling. One way we do this is by publishing intriguing, meaningful, and intricately woven narratives, and not shying away from the darker side of life.That's why we provide a home for authors tackling difficult topics and challenging questions, all while staying true to God's word. The Bible doesn't shirk from things, and we don't believe authors should either.The Christian publishing industry has focused on two primary areas: Romance and Non-Fiction. Between those, there are amazing indie publishers providing a space for Christian Fiction. However, S. D. Howard, the founder of Story-weaver Publishing, noticed there were few places for books of a darker tone or that dealt with more sensitive topics.The long-term goal is to provide a home for Christian authors who feel called to tackle the darkness to thereby shine the Light. This by no means excludes authors who write lighter material or ones that are not overtly Christian in nature.\xa0S. D. Howard's publishing journey started with hybrid publishing, and he saw the tremendous opportunity it provided to authors who wanted to go indie, but didn't necessarily have all the resources.The combination of crowdfunding and hybrid publishing brings together so many possibilities, which is why we aim to pair the two together for the benefit of the author.\u200bBy crowdfunding the cost of publishing, the author is not only able to cover their costs to publish, but also pre-sell their book to family, friends, and fans. Doing this also allows authors to have stretch goals like getting a hardcover edition, or paying a narrator to create an audiobook.""]"

I am also making jewelry for my customers and have decided to involve people to the extent that I am going to have a ""make your own jewelry"" table. I volunteer at Christmas Unlimited and have always catered to children, so I have many unique pieces that they could not buy (or make) anywhere else. My least expensive item will be $1.00 and my most expensive will be $60.00. The $60.00 items are blankets that I hand make. Anyone can order anything I make in another color or more customized to them. I want my space at the flea market to look more like a store than a booth.

My goal is to expand my online shop with a large variety of handmade products created from crystals, minerals, clay, metals, and other natural materials.\xa0Crystals, stones, and everything else organic are great reminders of natural beauty, and in my time working with them, I have found my passion! I love creating unique and one of a kind pieces and would love the chance to share my passion and positive energy with the world.  Utilizing art and construction techniques combined with methods I naturally discovered, I believe my style will quickly find its own place in the jewelry and fashion market. \xa0\n\n\nCitrine Pendant, Amethyst Hamsa Ring, Lemurian Quartz Ring, and Kyanite Pendant.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fiance and I are so devoted to this endeavor that we have planned a move to Colorado in August, near the Rocky Mountains. Living there, I will have access to material sources that would otherwise be unavailable, for either no or very reduced costs.\n\n\nJasper, Howlite, and Quartzite with Turtle.\n\n\n\nWith my own resources, I have been able to create a number of pieces that have already sold.  However, I am currently unable to launch a comprehensive site due to a lack of tools and supplies.  With the help of the Kickstarter community, I know I will have the materials to create and maintain a variety of products to stock the site with.\n\n\nGarnet, Tiger's Eye, Onyx, and Hamsa.\n\n\n\nAll pieces that I create are one of a kind, utilizing the natural color and form of crystals. \xa0Even replicated, each piece from bracelet to pendant reflects the individuality of the stones themselves. \xa0As of now, I am able to create pieces using mostly Amethyst, Quartz, Citrine, and Kyanite. With the funds raised by pledges, the possibilities will be endless! \xa0I intend to use those funds to purchase high quality wire for wrapping and embellishing, as well as raw crystals, beads, cording and tools. \xa0In addition, I would like to acquire a rock tumbler, allowing me to gather my own raw crystals to use for jewelry. \xa0In doing so, I will cut down on the cost of construction, resulting in lower product prices and a higher chance of success. \xa0Raw crystals that I gather myself but do not use for construction can be sold in bulk.\n\n\nSmoky Quartz. Amethyst, Brass, and Quartz Pendants.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable products will be Rings, Bracelets, Necklaces, Pendants, Accessory Clips, Loc Wraps, Pet Collars and Collar Clips.Products will be shipped worldwide and posted by the next day.Each product will come in an eco-friendly box with a unique, hand-written scroll detailing information on the stones used.\n\n\nCitrine and Amethyst Pet Collars with Suede Cording.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the funds raised by pledges, I hope to create a self-sustaining creation machine! \xa0But that's not the end! \xa0If successful, I will be able to eventually branch into hair clips and headbands, home decor, and more!Reward Time!If I am able to reach my goal, supporters will have the chance to choose from a selection of crystals and minerals for their gift. \xa0If you don't have a material preference, you can tell me you favorite color, season, or style of clothing. \xa0I very much look forward to creating the gifts for my supporters!\n\n\nTerminated Clear Quartz and Lapis Lazuli Wire Ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImperial, Chinese, and Fancy Jasper Accessory Clip.""]"

friends, throwing the ball around with the kids in the backyard or competitive league play on the weekends, we can't get enough.\xa0But flag football hasn't changed since it's was first played in the 1940's.We want to transform the game for both backyard enthusiasts and serious flag footballers\xa0with wearable fiber-optics and interactive LED technology.Our innovative, lighted uniforms and equipment means that playing time is no longer limited by daylight or the cost and hassle of finding a lit field.\xa0We have a modern take on traditional flag football — and want to move it beyond how it’s been played for the last 75 years — with the AfterDark Flag Football Kit.\n\n\nAfterDark Technologies Flag Football Gear\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't find time during the day for your favorite sports?\n\nDon't want the hassle and expense of renting a lighted field?\n\nLooking for a new experience for your teams or your children?\n\nAfterDark Flag Football lets players interact in the dark using fiber-optic jerseys that light the players and flags, LED cones to define the field and end-zones, and an LED-powered football. Interactive technology provides a visual rush countdown on the quarterback’s jersey, eliminating inconsistent “one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi” counts. And all of it comes packaged in a convenient carryall, for easy travel and storage. \nThe AfterDark Flag Football ExperienceFor six months, we’ve field-tested our gear with some of the largest flag football leagues in both the U.S. and Europe — hosting live games using AfterDark. We’ve incorporated feedback into the final product design and have been overwhelmed with the incredible response to the AfterDark Flag Football experience. \n\n\nThe AfterDark Flag Football Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are proud to work with so many enthusiastic flag fans including adult social teams such as Social Boston Sports, Texas Sports and Social Club, and Santa Monica Beach Flag Football; intramural teams including Babson College and Assumption College, and children's leagues including New England Flag Football — an NFL Flag league for 5-14 year olds. AfterDark’s Flag Football Kit has also been tested with flag football leagues across England and Scotland, in partnership with Pulling the Flag. \n\n\n\n\nAfterDark testers include some of the biggest flag football leagues in the U.S. and Europe\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the AfterDark Flag Football KitFor Kickstarter, we would like to thank pledges with kits for two players (1v1) up to full teams of fourteen players (7v7).\xa0Each kit contains:\nFiber-optic jerseys that light the player and the flags (Each jersey can be easily switched between six colors and comes with a pair of flags)\nLED cones to define the field and end-zones\xa0\nAn LED-powered football\xa0\nA travel bag for easy travel and storage\xa0\nA spare jersey for referees in 5v5 kits and upwards\n-\xa0Basically\xa0everything you need to play flag football AfterDark!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterback Visual Rush CountdownThe AfterDark Flag Football Kit replaces the inconsistent “one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi” quarterback countdowns with an interactive LED in each jersey. Simply press the quarterback countdown button, then take the hike and the quarterback’s jersey counts down visually with alternating colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect for Children Ages Six and UpAnd the best part? AfterDark Flag Football is not just for adult leagues and intramurals. It’s also designed for children ages six and up. Whether it’s an official league game or a fun scrimmage, you can play on beaches, parks, campsites, even in the backyard. With the sun setting earlier, extend your playing time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur fiber-optic and LED-powered jerseys will be available in two sizes: Youth and Adult. Each version is adjustable for a wider range of fit within each size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you’ve decided to back us on Kickstarter. What happens next?\nWe are ready to start full scale manufacturing. Our circuit boards are fully designed and tested; our supplier in California is ready to begin production. Upon successful funding via Kickstarter, the next major milestone for bringing AfterDark Flag Football gear to market is to cut injection mold tooling and produce test samples. Our mechanical engineer has identified relevant suppliers; we are ready to take our designs and make this dream a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the AfterDark Technologies Team\nEach year, more than 20 million people play flag football. And we are no exception. However, life gets busy; and we would be frustrated when there weren’t enough daylight hours to get field time. We were deterred by the cost and hassle of renting lit fields and the disappointment of cutting games short when it got too dark.Our goal is to combine our love of sports and technology to create a way to play flag football anytime, without the need for a lighted field. But our idea grew beyond that — now we want to do introduce you to the AfterDark experience. We want to change the playing field — literally — with fiber-optics and LED technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Wilson, Founder and CEOOur founder and CEO Dan Wilson is serial inventor across a range of industries, including high tech and medical devices.

baker,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1555102420/nixie-tube-calculator?ref=discovery_category_newest,"['StoryThe Nixie Tube Calculator is a fusion of vintage and modern technology. It’s intended to serve as much as a piece of art as it is to serve as a functional device. The calculator is available in a variety of kit forms, depending on how much existing components you have on hand, as well as a fully assembled version.\n\n\nAssembled Calculator\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve focused on two key concepts: hackability and modularity. Hackability is achieved by using a Raspberry Pi to serve as the ‘brain’ of the clock. The Raspberry Pi is a robust inexpensive single board computer that typically runs the Linux operating system. The calculator software is written in Python and source code will be provided. Modularity is achieved by separating the project into several subassemblies. There are three keypads and two Nixie Displays modules. An I2C bus connects the keypads and displays, allowing you to easily reconfigure, delete, or add additional modules. The basic design could easily be extended to a 12-digit calculator, or a 4x2 keypad could be swapped with a 4x4 keypad to yield more functions. \n\n\nNixie Display Boards, Front and Back View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nixie display modules, pictured above, feature four tubes per module. Rather than multiplexing, an individual dedicated driver chip is assigned to each tube. The drivers are then connected to I2C IO expanders, which in turn talk to the I2C bus on the Raspberry Pi. There is a provision for LED tube backlighting already designed into the driver boards, although the pictures above do not show the LED backlighting in use. It’s an option that’s there if you want it. \n\n\nKeypads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe keypads, pictured above, use Cherry MX blue key switches with custom printed keycaps. The Cherry MX blue is a quality key switch, often favored by gamers for its tactile feel and clicky sound. Key caps can easily be removed and replaced. If you don’t like the functions that I have chosen for the keys, you could have your own keycaps printed.\n\n\nPower Supply Board and Raspberry Pi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final subassembly of the kit is the power supply board, pictured above next to the raspberry pi. A standard 12V wall wart is used to supply power to the power supply board, which features a 5V switching regulator to supply the pi and other electronics, as well as a high voltage switching power supply to power the Nixie Tubes. The entire kit is designed using through-hole components, making it accessible to builders who do not have the complex tools or skills that are necessary to work with SMD devices. A high-quality temperature controlled soldering iron is recommended (a $90 Hakko is a good choice). Only two IO pins on the Raspberry Pi are used for the I2C communication to the modules, leaving the vast majority of IO pins available for custom hacks should you choose to do so. \n\n\nPC-Boards\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pc-boards are all professionally designed using modern CAD software, and will be professionally manufactured using a reliable board fabricator. They will feature all the amenities of modern pcboard manufacturing, such as plating of surfaces for easy soldering, solder mask, etc. Note that although only one of each pc-board is pictured above, the kits will come with two nixie display boards and two 4x4 keypads\nThe case is laser-cut acrylic. For the kits, it will come as a set of flat pieces that are easily assembled using 4-40 machine screw hardware. The case currently pictured in the video and screenshots is prototype quality. The final case that is included in the kits will have a full back and bottom sections to keep fingers out of the electronics.']"

This pattern of light is used to coach your breathing pattern, which encourages your breaths to become longer as time progresses. To ensure that enough light is delivered, I put four LEDs on the device; however, the maximum brightness is adjustable to allow for different user tastes. In order to cater to varying heights of nightstands, the device is able to pivot to encompass a wide range of scenarios. For those who sleep with a partner, I added side-shields to concentrate the light\'s focus, reducing stray light that may annoy others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose laser cutting to make the kit easy to ship and mass produce. With the target order volume (around 1000 units) in mind, laser cutting proved to be an affordable way to create a custom design.The circuit board was designed with fritzing, and the logic and programming were done with arduino, which are both open source tools.All aspects of the design (arduino code, circuit board designs, mechanical design files, website assets, photos, and documentation)\xa0are open source and are available for download on my github page. I will continue to refine the design and produce more prototypes using the Kickstarter funding, and during the development time, I encourage advanced users to fork the repository and provide me with suggestions and ideas to include in the final product!Why Red Light?\nThe Sleep Sensei uses light to help you fall asleep, so I wanted to make sure that the light reduces any negative impacts that late-night light can have. Blue/white light actually keeps you awake, while green light has a similar effect and can\xa0suppress your melatonin output. This leaves red light, which ""has the least power to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin."" It\'s recommended to adjust the Sleep Sensei\'s brightness such that you can just barely see it through your eyelids, ensuring that the intensity is low enough to avoid any negative effects.How it WorksThe Sleep Sensei works by reducing your breathing rate, causing increased relaxation and bringing your breathing pattern closer to the reduced breathing pace that is typical of sleep. It also has the \xa0benefit of giving you something to focus on for an extended period of time, which can be helpful for those with sleep issues due to active minds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing calming red light, the Sleep Sensei produces a sine wave pattern of light that you follow with your\xa0breathing.\xa0As the light begins to brighten, the user inhales, and as the light dims, the user exhales. As time passes, the breath length increases up to the maximum length specified by the user’s settings. It is a very gradual and unnoticeable change that happens progressively over time.Who it\'s forThe Sleep Sensei primarily helps those with sleeping problems caused by stress or an overactive mind at bedtime. The current design of the Sleep Sensei is primarily designed for users that can lie on their side or stomach to fall asleep; however, if you prefer to fall asleep on your back for medical or other reasons, you can still use the Sleep Sensei on an elevated surface to point down towards your eyes.\nFeatures\nBright and Directable LightThe main innovation of the Sleep Sensei is its use of bright light that is capable of being seen through the eyelids in order to make it visible with the user\'s eyes closed. Other similar products are just not bright enough to achieve this and require open eyes.The Sleep Sensei has a pivoting base which allows you to shine the coaching light directly at the eyelids no matter how tall, short, or non-existent your nightstand is.Adjustable BrightnessThe maximum brightness of the Sleep Sensei can be adjusted at any time using the adjustment wheel. This allows you to shine the Sensei\'s light on a wall for eyes-open coaching, dim it a bit if you are sensitive to light, or stare right at it for a meditation session.Customizable Breathing PatternAnother unique innovation of the Sleep Sensei is the user\'s ability to program custom breath lengths to suit their preferences and breathing rates. The user can choose initial and final breaths ranging from four to 20 seconds in duration. Defaults are available as a starting point.Simple DesignWhen I set out to make this project, I was determined to make the final design as simple as possible to keep the price low and to make using the Sleep Sensei simple and easy.Feedback and the Sleep Study\xa0When I first created the Sleep Sensei, I used it on myself for several weeks resulting in a general feeling that it was helping me to fall asleep faster. I wanted to quantify this somehow, so I began tracking my sleep using a sleep tracking app on my smartphone. After seeing a significant positive trend in the amount of time it took me to fall asleep using the Sleep Sensei, I decided that I wanted data from more users to see if the device worked for others. Thus I started the Sleep Study.\xa0The hypothesis was simple: “The Sleep Sensei will reduce users’ average time to fall asleep.” I made posts on reddit’s /r/insomnia, /r/arduino, and /r/quantifiedself subreddits asking for volunteers for the study using this advertisement \xa0(The device was initially named the Sleep Coach). Of the five volunteers who replied to the advertisement and participated, all of them showed some improvement in the time it took them to fall asleep. The full report can be found here, and the raw data from the study can be found here.\xa0Some comments from the study participants:\xa0“I think the quality of sleep has been improving, and I think that’s the Sleep Sensei. When I start having issues again I pull it out and it does help” – Alice S, TX\xa0“I was really impressed with the Sleep Sensei- it cut the amount of time it took me to fall asleep by about half … based on the survey, I basically don’t have insomnia anymore and it feels that way”\xa0Marijke S, MA“The Sleep Sensei allows me to fall asleep in at least under 30 minutes, sometimes even as few as 7 minutes, which is great for me! I would definitely recommend this device to anyone who is on the search for something new to help them fall asleep, someone who perhaps has tried every other sleep aid without finding anything that truly helps yet. The Sleep Sensei is awesome!” – Kate B, GA\xa0“I’ve noticed a HUGE decrease in how long it takes me to fall asleep which has been wonderful! I really like the machine.  It’s easy to use and works well.” – Kelly P, LA\xa0Now I want to reach a much wider audience with the Sleep Sensei by launching this Kickstarter. Hopefully it will help others as much as it helped the study participants!Featured by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sleep Sensei Story\n\n\xa0I have trouble falling asleep at night. I used to take over-the-counter remedies, and I\'ve tried prescription stuff, but these either made me feel groggy the next day or had side effects that were not worth the benefits. I then stumbled upon some smartphone apps and devices that use a rising and falling pattern of light to help you fall sleep by training your breathing. I tried these with some success, but I found that they all had one major flaw: they required your eyes to be open. Who in the world tries to fall asleep with their eyes open?!\n\nUsing my arduino skills, I set out to create a device that will help coach my breathing to ease myself to sleep with my eyes closed. Thus the Sleep Sensei was born, with its pivoting base and four ultra-bright red LEDs that can shine through eyelids, it was created to address the problems of similar apps and devices.Choosing the Kickstarter GoalWhen I first started producing Sleep Sensei for the sleep study, I created a simple design that I could manufacture cheaply using parts from my local hardware store. Each one was made by hand, a process that took about 90 minutes per Sleep Sensei (longer if I had to troubleshoot a problem with my low-quality homemade circuit boards).After receiving such positive feedback from the sleep study, I wanted to bring the Sleep Sensei to the masses, but I knew I couldn’t continue spending hours just to produce a dozen devices. Thus I have turned to outsourcing the circuit board manufacture and assembly as well as making the mechanical components by laser cutting. I secured multiple quotes and found that I need to produce at least 1000 Sleep Senseis in order to make them economically viable. For example, a batch of 100 circuit boards costs over four times more per board than a batch of 1000 boards!The TimelineAssuming the Kickstarter is fully funded, this is the plan to make Sleep Sensei a reality:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards Photos and DetailsNote: the Sleep Sensei is still under development, so the images below will differ from the final product.The bare board:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust the board. Provide your own electrical components and soldering skills to complete the board, or just hang it on your keychain as a token of appreciation for helping this project become a reality.The Sleep Sensei Kit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncludes laser-cut parts, assembled electronics board, battery pack (2 AA batteries not included), hinge hardware, and all other necessary hardware (TBD). It should take less than 5 minutes to assemble and will include easy to follow instructions.The Assembled Sleep Sensei:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe completed Sleep Sensei fully assembled by yours truly.Logo designed by RMRDesign']"

She took many months to test, retest and find the perfect combination of environmentally safe ingredients that will help keep your brushes clean and reusable.\xa0The formula is safe and easy to use. All that you need to do is just add PaintSoap to about half a gallon of water, stir with the brush and let it soak for about 5 minutes. It's also quite entertaining to watch as well, which is an added bonus. \n\n\nWe're a team of do-it-yourselfers with a dream of getting this product into the hands of everyone that wants a fast, safe, and eco-friendly option for taking care of the worst part of painting... the clean-up. Please donate and help us get this product to the world.\xa0Latex, Acryilic, or any water-based paintWhether you're painting a craft project with acrylics or remodeling a room, PaintSoap will help you clean your brushes so you can use them time and time again as if they were new.\xa0\n\n\nGiving Back1% of each PaintSoap purchase will help bring clean water access to communities in need.
